# Clifford's Pictures

My grandfather took a lot of pictures. He had a Polaroid instant camera hanging from his neck at every Christmas, Thanksgiving, birthday and barbecue.

He passed a few years ago, and we discovered about a thousand photos in bags and boxes. I decided to scan them and put them on the web to share with my family.
